# quarterchords
HTML standalone quarter tone piano visualisation and audio playback. This is just a small webtoy I made, nothing special; I just want to host it on Github Pages.
## How to use
Type notes into the text box, and they'll show up on the piano. Press the `Listen` button to listen to the chord. Notes are space- or newline-seperated; accidentals are `# ^ v b` for sharp, half-sharp, half-flat, and flat respectively. Add a number at the end of the note to specify octave; by default 4. Piano range is C3 - B6.

### Disclaimer
This has only been tested for MacOS on Firefox, and it's pretty buggy on other platforms. Might figure it out later.
